# Keyword-Extraction

### Input.json

An input file for the user where one can enter:

i. The categoryID of the document corpus to extract the keywords.
ii. The threshold cutoff for similarity with reference keyword list.
    a. Low threshold score => low similarity with the reference keyword list.
    b. High threshold score => high similarity with the reference keyword list.
iii. Reference list: The main keywords which the user believes are important for the specific categoryID.

### RunScript.bat

A double click file which runs the whole module as a black-box. Users who hail from a non-technical background can easily extract keywords on their own.
